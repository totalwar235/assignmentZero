Algorithm: Selection Sort

Techniques: reusable code

Problem: more testing, this was solved by having a loop compare both strings to each other and if anything was not the same then it would flag as incorrect.

Applications: A selection sort is a very generic sorting algorithm and can be used in a variety of situations but with the way I have layed out the files I can reuse DubRandArray.
java for assignments in the future or even continue down the library path approach for other assignments that do not use double arrays.
****updated: I implimented a quick sort, added timing so we can compair how long each sort takes in milliseconds and added some additional testing.
